# 📚 Library Management System (Frontend)

This is a simple Library Management System UI made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

I created this project to practice frontend development and understand how real-world dashboard layouts work like sidebar navigation, tables, forms, modals, and theme switching.

The design is clean and beginner-friendly and supports both Light Mode and Dark Mode.
